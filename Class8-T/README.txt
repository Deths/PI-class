Problem 1:
Calculate the average of a	classfrom the grade	
of its	10	students.

Problem 2:
Write a program to fill a vector of integers with
20 terms of an arithmetic progression whose
initial term and the common difference must be
reported by the user. Only after the vector has
been filled in, the program should displayed it
on the screen.

Problem 3:
Consider the existence of an integer type vector
A filled with random numbers. Write a program
to generate a vector B , of the same type,
containing the same elements of A, but in
reverse order (the first element of B must be the
last element of A, and so on)
