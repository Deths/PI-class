Problem 1:
Write the ValidateInterger function that requests an
integer and validate it so that it is within a range. The
range limits will be passed by parameter. Also write the
main function that calls the function with the following
values:
§ValidateInterger(0, 100) // accepts values between 0 e 100
§ValidateInterger(-50, 50) // accepts values between -50 e 50
Attention: The number must be read inside the
function and the (valid) value must be returned by the
function

Problem 2:
Write a function that receives by
parameter a ”filled” vector. The
function has to return the position of
the greatest value (element).

Problem 3:
Construct a function that receives, by
parameter, a matrix (filled) and their
respective dimensions and returns T
(true) if there is any row with all the
elements zeroed and F (false) otherwise.
