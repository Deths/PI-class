Problem1:
* Write a program that asks for 15 ages and
displays the oldest of those entered.
* Tip: You do NOT need to store 15 numbers. It is
enough that you compare the highest current
number with the new entry and update the value
of the highest number if necessary.

Problem2:
Write a program that requests the user to enter a value
to be drawn and to show the amount of money bills of
each amount to be displayed to the customer. The cash
machine must return as few cells as possible that total
the requested value. Suppose the box has 50, 10, 5, and
1 notes.
* ATTENTION - The program must validate data entry in
order not to process NEGATIVE values and no
withdrawals greater than 2000 (two thousand reais).
Every time the user enters negative values, the program
must request new values.

Problem3:
Write an algorithm to show on the screen
whether each N number, typed by the user is
even or odd. The algorithm should stop running
if the user types a number less than zero.

Problem4:
Write a program in Java to find the perfect
numbers between 1 and 50000

Problem5:
Write a program in Java to find the last prime
number occur before the entered number.
