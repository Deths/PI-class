Problem1:
Write a Java program that has a module that
receives, by parameter, a person's height and
gender and returns to their ideal weight. For
men calculate ideal weight using the following
formula: ideal weight = 72.7 * height - 58 and, for
women: ideal weight = 62.1 * height - 44.7. Call
this module in your main program.

Problem2:
Write a Java program that has a module that
returns "true" if the number entered is positive
and "false" if the number is negative. Use this
module in the main program, where the user
must enter a number and your program should
tell the user if the entry number is positive or
negative.

Problem3:
Write a Java program that has a module that
indicates whether a point (x, y) is located inside
or outside a rectangle. The rectangle is defined
by its lower left vertices (x0, y0) and upper right
(x1, y1). The function must have as return value
1, if the point is inside the rectangle, and 0
otherwise, obeying the prototype:
int dentro_ret (int x0, int y0, int x1, int y1, int x, 
int y);

Problem4:
Write a Java program that has a module that
tests whether an integer is prime or not. This
function must obey the following prototype and
have as return value 1 if n is prime and 0
otherwise.
* int primo (int n);
