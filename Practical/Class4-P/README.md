Problem1:
The Fibonacci series is formed by the sequence:
* 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...
* Develop a program that is capable of generating
the series up to the nth term. The nth term must
be typed by the user, and necessarily a value
greater than zero.
* Develop the program with data entry
validation.The program should print the n terms
requested by the user.

Problem2:
Develop a program that calculates the factorial
of a positive integer provided by the user.
Perform data validation. The factorial of zero is 1
and the factorial of 1 is 1.

Problem3:
Develop a program that prints the prime
numbers between 1 and the positive integer
entered by the user. You must do data
validation.

Problem4:
Develop a program that reads the code of the
ordered items and the desired quantities.
* Calculate and show the amount to be paid per
item (price * quantity) and the total price of the
order.
* Consider that the customer should inform when
the order should be finished.
