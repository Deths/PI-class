Problem1:
Write a program in Java that reads 10 integer
values and stores them in a Vector. After typing
the last value, print the elements whose indices
are even (0, 2, 4, ...).
* OBS: MANDATORY USE OF VECTORS AND
LOOPS

Problem2:
Write a program in Java that reads 15 names of
people and stores them in a Vector. After typing
the last name, print them in reverse order (ie the
last name you entered must be the first one to
be printed, etc.)

Problem3:
Write a program in Java that reads 8 elements in
an integer vector A. Construct another vector B,
of the same dimension of A, with its elements
being the multiplication of the corresponding
element of A by 3. Show the elements of A, the
elements of B.

Problem4:
Write a program in Java that captures 20
integers in a vector A and construct vector B with
the elements of A, but inverted, that is, the first
element of A becomes the last element of B, and
so on. Show all 2 vectors.
* OBS: You will have to enter the values of vector
A manually in the program code.

Problem5:
Dot product: Given the vectors u = (a, b) and v =
(c, d), we define the scalar product between
vectors u and v, as the real number obtained by:
* uv = a*c + b*d
* Given two vectors x and y, both with n elements,
write a program that determines the dot product
of these vectors.

Problem6:
Given a sequence of n real numbers, write a program that
determines the numbers that make up the sequence and the
number of times each occur in it.

Problem7:
Given two natural numbers m and n and
two ordered sequences (vectors) with m and n i
ntegers, obtain a single ordered sequence
containing all elements of the original sequences
without repetition. This sequence should be
stored in a third vector.
