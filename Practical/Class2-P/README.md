Problem1:
Write a Java program that displays on the
screen the triple of an integer entered by the
user. If the number entered by the user is
negative, it must be converted into its positive
equivalent before the display of your triple.

Problem2:
Develop a Java program that, given the age of a
swimmer, it classifies he/she into each of the
following categories:
* InfantA = 5 to 7 years old
* Infant B = 8 to 11 years old
* Juvenile A = 12 to 13 years old
* Juvenile B = 14 to 17 years old
* Adults = Over 17 years old

Problem3:
Write a Java program that, given a student's
average, states whether it is approved, failed, or
needs a recovery exam. The student will be
approved when the average is equal to or
greater than seven (07), failing if the average is
less than four (04), and will needs a recovery
exam if the average is equal to or greater than
four and less than seven.

Problem4:
Write a program that the user types an integer
and the absolute value of this integer number is
printed on the screen.

Problem5:
Write a program that the user types a real
number (type: double) and the rounding and the
ceiling of this number are printed on the screen.

Problem6:
Write a program that the user types a real
number (type: double) and the floor of this
number is printed on the screen.

Problem7:
Write a program that the user enters two real
numbers (type: double) and that the minimum
and maximum values of these numbers are
printed on the screen.

Problem8:
Write a program that the user types the numbers
(type: double) X and Y and that the XY value is
printed on the screen.

Problem9:
Write a program that the user types a real
number (type: double) and the value of the
square root of the number entered is printed on
the screen.

Problem10:
Write a program that prints on the screen a
pseudorandom number between 0 and 1.
