Problem 1:
Write a Java program that reads a 3x3 array and
displays only all elements of the second row.
The user must fill in the matrix.

Problem 2:
Write a program in Java that reads from the
keyboard the arrays A and B, both with 5 rows
and 3 columns. Create a matrix C of the same
dimensions, where C is formed by the sum of
the matrices A and B. Show the elements of
matrix C.
* C[i][j] = A[i][j] + B[i][j]

Problem 3:
Write a program in Java that reads from the
keyboard two vectors A and B. Each of the
vectors has 12 integers. Construct a matrix
C2 x 12, where the first row of matrix C must be
formed by the elements of vector A multiplied by
2, and the second row must be formed by the
elements of vector B subtracted from 5. Display
the elements of matrix C.

Problem 4:
Write a Java program that reads two arrays (A
and B), with 4x4 dimensions. This same
program must generate a matrix C consisting of
the multiplication of matrix A by matrix B.
