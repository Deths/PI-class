Problem 1:
An integer x is perfect number, if a positive
integer that is equal to the sum of its proper
divisors, except itself, is equal to x. For
example, 6 is perfect since 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Write a
program that prints if x is a perfect number

Problem2:
Write a program that prints all the perfect
numbers between 1 e 104

Problem 3:
Find the sum of all the primes below two
thousand.
