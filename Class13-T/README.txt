Problem 1:
Implement a function that returns the nth term of the
Fibonacci series. The Fibonacci series is given by:
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ..., that is, the first two terms
are equal to 1 and each next term is the sum of the
two previous terms. The program must perform data
validation to accept only n> 0. You are NOT able to
use vector, in the solution. This function must
obey the prototype:
public static int fibonacci (int n);

Problem 2:
Implement a function that takes as a parameter
a vector of double numbers (vector) of size n
and returns how many negative numbers are
stored in that vector. You will also have to
implement a method that fills the vector. This
function must obey the prototype:
public static int Negatives(double[] vector);

Problem 3:
Write a function that receives a double Amxn
matrix and returns its transpose (If B is the
transposed matrix of A then aij = bji).
